# generator-angular

## Getting Started

### Setup

```bash
npm install -g yo
git clone git@github.com:itsthatguy/generator-angular.git
cd generator-angular
npm link
```

You're now done in the `generator-angular` folder, and can `cd` the hell out! 

### Finally, using the generator:

Create a directory for the project that you will generate into

```bash
mkdir <your_project>
cd <your_project>
yo angular
```
